faq.default.title=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.default.subtitle=Everything you need to know about booking Belkis and her impactful keynotes.
faq.home.1.q=What makes you different from other speakers?
faq.home.1.a=Most speakers tell you what you want to hear. I tell you what you need to hear. I don’t do generic motivation that fades by Tuesday. I name the pattern everyone sees but no one says out loud. Ten minutes into my keynote, the room goes silent, not because people are bored, but because I’m holding up a mirror they can’t look away from. If you want inspiration that feels good in the moment, I’m not your speaker. If you want interaction and transformation that lasts, let’s talk.
faq.home.2.q=Do You Tailor To Our Industry?
faq.home.2.a=Yes. Pre-event interview and internal language mapping are included.
faq.home.3.q=Is this a “motivational” talk?
faq.home.3.a=No. It’s a practical framework for trust, communication, and measurable behavior.
faq.home.4.q=How far in advance should we book?
faq.home.4.a=Most 2026 events are booking now (6-9 months in advance). I only take a limited number of engagements per year to ensure I can customize each one properly. If your event is within 3 months, reach out immediately. I may have a cancellation or be able to accommodate rush bookings depending on the timing.
faq.home.5.q=What’s your fee range?
faq.home.5.a=My keynote fees vary based on event type, location, and customization level. Virtual events have different pricing. For exact pricing and availability, use the “Check Availability” button above or schedule a consultation. I’ll send you a detailed proposal within 48 hours.
faq.pricing.1.q=Can I switch plans later?
faq.pricing.1.a=Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. Prorated charges will apply.
faq.pricing.2.q=Is there a free trial?
faq.pricing.2.a=We offer a 14-day free trial on the Pro plan so you can explore all features.
faq.pricing.3.q=What payments do you accept?
faq.pricing.3.a=We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and wire transfers for Enterprise.
faq.pricing.4.q=Do you offer refunds?
faq.pricing.4.a=Yes, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied.

bento.description=You’ve been performing, giving, and overthinking so much that the parts of you that matter most — your energy, voice, relationships, purpose, and integrity — are running low.
bento.item1.title=That’s not burnout
bento.item1.desc=You look successful. Six figures. Good title. Everyone thinks you’re fine. Inside? You’re liquidating everything that makes you human. Your emotional reserves, authentic voice, relational capital, purposeful direction, and integrity. That’s emotional bankruptcy.

bento.item2.desc=I work with women ready to rescue themselves from their past and build a life that is confident, healthy, happy and where you are your own hero.
bento.item3.title=You’re not failing.
