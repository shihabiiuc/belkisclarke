# Abused at work? Here’s what you should do

Abuse in the workplace involves any behavior that causes physical or emotional harm and includes discrimination, harassment, violence, and bullying. Dealing with abuse in the workplace is extremely difficult, and victims often feel isolated and alone.

If you are experiencing abuse at work, know this: **you are not alone**. There are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and regain control.

This article outlines what you can do to combat workplace abuse.

## Initiate a Dialogue

If you are being abused at work, initiating a dialogue can sometimes be the first step.

In certain situations — especially with verbal abuse — the person may not fully recognize that their behavior is inappropriate or harmful. Verbal abuse in the workplace can include:

- Yelling
- Making threats
- Name-calling
- Blaming or shaming
- Public humiliation

If you feel safe doing so, calmly address the behavior and ask the person to stop.

If you are afraid to speak directly to your abuser, discuss the situation with a manager, supervisor, or trusted colleague. Silence protects the behavior — not you. If no one knows what is happening, they cannot intervene or support you.

Speaking up is not creating conflict. It is advocating for your safety.

## File a Complaint with HR

Documenting abuse is one of the most important protective actions you can take.

Filing a formal complaint with Human Resources (HR) creates a written record of the behavior and places responsibility on the organization to respond.

When filing a complaint, document:

- The date, time, and location of the incident
- The exact words or statements made
- Your response to the incident
- Any previous occurrences

Detailed documentation strengthens your position, particularly if the abuse continues or affects others. These records may also serve as evidence if legal action becomes necessary.

## Take Legal Action

Once you file a formal complaint, your employer becomes legally responsible for addressing the situation. However, outcomes may not always feel adequate.

If your organization fails to properly handle the complaint, you may consider legal action.

To pursue a harassment lawsuit, you must first file an administrative charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or a designated state agency. After reviewing your claim, the EEOC may:

- Dismiss the charge
- Encourage settlement
- Initiate an investigation
- Request corrective action

Once the agency processes your case, you will receive a "right to sue" letter. This document is required before filing a federal lawsuit.

Understanding your legal rights can empower you to take informed next steps.

## Should You Return to Work After Experiencing Abuse?

Returning to work after abuse can feel overwhelming — especially if the person responsible remains in the workplace.

If you feel emotionally strong enough to return, that decision is yours. If you need time off or decide to seek employment elsewhere, that is equally valid.

Healing is not linear. Take the time you need to process your experience and rebuild your confidence. When you are ready, you can return stronger, clearer, and more self-assured.

## You Deserve Safety and Respect

If you are experiencing workplace abuse, do not delay action. Speak up. Document incidents. File a complaint if necessary.

Most importantly, give yourself permission to heal.
